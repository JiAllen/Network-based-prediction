# Network-based-prediction

The density maps of receptors/transporters from prior molecular imaging studies are already publicly available in the “JuSpace” toolbox which can be freely downloaded from the website at https://github.com/juryxy/JuSpace. JuSpace is a comprehensive Matlab-based toolbox for the integration of PET- and SPECT- derived modalities with other brain imaging data (Dukart et al., 2020). 

For the meta-analytic networks, the coordinates used for generating the nodes have been reported in the source meta-analytic publications. Here we moreover provide text files containing the peak-activation coordinates for each of the 17 networks investigated in the present work as well as the NIFTI images denoting the node-locations

Our predictive modeling is based on a relevance vector machine (RVM) (Tipping, 2001) as implemented in the SparseBayes package (http://www.miketipping.com/index.htm). The RVM refers to a specialization of the general Bayesian framework which has an identical functional form to the support vector machine (SVM). To use  and add to your working directory. 
10-fold cross-validation (stratified for site), leave-one-site-out cross-validation, as well as training models within-sample and then validate in independent samples
